# Hi there, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a natural problem solver and optimizer, always looking at the big picture to see where I can make the most difference. I'm comfortable in multiple roles, and I love using my analytical thinking and creativity to come up with solutions. I believe in challenging ideas and I'm not a fan of doing things a certain way just because they've always been done that way.

I enjoy sparring with other experts, valuing abilities and insights over titles. I communicate openly and honestly about my perspectives and I like being surrounded by people who, like me, are passionate about improving the "quality of life" within an organization.

## My Developer Journey

My expertise in software mainly lies in Front-End development. Over the years, I've gained diverse experience as a developer. This ranges from programming RFID printers and installing them on-site, to "live" testing of self-written handheld software in a recreated Ebola camp for Doctors Without Borders, to writing functional designs in collaboration with board members, to guiding managers in making better decisions about change management.

## My Scrum Master Journey

In addition to my development work, I am also a Certified Scrum Master. I was part in guiding a large international company through its Agile transformation. This involved setting up and streamlining a variety of processes, facilitating communication between departments, and continually working on improving the overall quality of life within the organization.

Outside of work, you can find me on the terraces, enjoying a beer with friends or (former) colleagues when the weather is nice.
